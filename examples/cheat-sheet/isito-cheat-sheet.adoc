== What is Service Mesh and Istio

A *service mesh* is decentralized application networking infrastructure for making service-to-service communication safe, reliable, and understandable. A service mesh uses service proxies (that live with each service) to facilitate this functionality and each application talks through its own, co-located proxy. The proxies form the "mesh". 

Istio is a service mesh which allows you to connect, secure, and control the traffic for your microservices in an declarative and non-intrusive way. 

Some of the features that Istio enable for cloud-native applications:

* Intelligent routing and load balancing
* Resilience against network failures
* Policy enforcement between services
* Observability of your network communication
* Securing service to service communication

== Istio Architecture

Istio follows the typical service-mesh architecture with the following abstractions:

* **Data plane** which is composed of *Envoy* service proxies deployed as a sidecar along with your service through which all application traffic flows
* **Control plane** which manage and configure the data plane (*Envoy* service proxies); additionally the control plane manages back-end infrastructure that complements the data plane (like metrics, policy, and security engines). 

All communication within the *service mesh* happens through each application's *Envoy* proxy. Any network logic (retries, timeouts, circuit breaking, etc) is moved from your service into the service mesh.

== Key Concepts of Istio

== DestinationRule

A *DestinationRule* configures the set of rules to be applied when sending traffic to a service.
Some of the purposes of a *DestinationRule* are describing circuit breakers, load balancer, and TLS settings or define *subsets* (named versions) of the destination hosts so they can be reused in other Istio elements.

For example, to define two versions of a service named *recommendation* you could do:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: recommendation
  namespace: tutorial
spec:
  host: recommendation
  subsets:
  - labels:
      version: v1
    name: version-v1
  - labels:
      version: v2
    name: version-v2
```

In this example, the subsets are defined by labels on the services (platform specific; for example, Kubernetes uses labels on its Deployment objects and the labels used in the subsets here would refer to those Deployment labels). 

== VirtualService

A *VirtualService* describes the mapping between one or more user-addressable destinations to the actual destination inside the service mesh.

For example, to define a single "virtual service" where the traffic is split between two deployed versions with 90% going to version 1 and 10% going to version 2:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
  namespace: tutorial
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v2
      weight: 10
```

== ServiceEntry

A *ServiceEntry* is used to define services that exist outside of the service mesh but need to be made available to services within the mesh. A *ServiceEntry* is a way to add the details of a service into Istio's service registry. You can write  *VirtualService* and/or *DestinationRule* against a *ServiceEntry* just as if it was a mesh-native service.

For example to configure _httpbin_ external service:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: httpbin-egress-rule
  namespace: istioegress
spec:
  hosts:
  - httpbin.org
  ports:
  - name: http-80
    number: 80
    protocol: http
```

== Gateway

A *Gateway* is used to describe a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh for incoming/outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. You can use a  *VirtualService* to define routing rules (using the full power of Istio's routing capabilities) for traffic originating at the edge or destined for external services. 

To configures a *Gateway* to allow external HTTPS traffic for host foo.com into the mesh:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: foo-gateway
spec:
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
    hosts:
    - foo.com
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      serverCertificate: /tmp/tls.crt
      privateKey: /tmp/tls.key
```

<<<

== Getting started with Istio

*Istio* can be installed with _automatic sidecar injection_ or without it.
We recommend as starting point *without* _automatic sidecar injection_ so you understand each of the steps.

== Installing Istio

First you need to download Istio and register in `PATH`:

```bash
open https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/

cd istio-1.0.3
export ISTIO_HOME=`pwd`
export PATH=$ISTIO_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

You can install Istio into Kubernetes cluster by either using `helm install` or `helm template`. With `template` we can create all of the resource files explicitly and then apply them like in this example:

```yaml
$ helm template install/kubernetes/helm/istio \
    --name istio --namespace istio-system \
    --set sidecarInjectorWebhook.enabled=false \
    > $HOME/istio.yaml

kubectl create namespace istio-system
kubectl create -f $HOME/istio.yaml
```

Wait until all pods are up and running.

== Intelligent Routing

Routing some percentage of traffic between two versions of recommendation service:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
  namespace: tutorial
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v1
      weight: 75
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v2
      weight: 25
```

Routing to a specific version in case of prefixed URI and cookie with a value matching a regular expression:

```yaml
spec:
  hosts:
  - ratings
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        cookie:
          regex: "^(.*?;)?(user=jason)(;.*)?"
        uri:
          prefix: "/ratings/v2/"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: ratings
        subset: version-v2
```

<<<

Possible **match** options:

|===
|	Field		          | Type          |Description

a|	**uri**
a| `StringMatch`
a| URI value to match. `exact`, `prefix`, `regex`

a| **scheme**
a| `StringMatch`
a| URI Scheme to match. `exact`, `prefix`, `regex`

a| **method**
a| `StringMatch`
a| Http Method to match. `exact`, `prefix`, `regex`

a| **authority**
a| `StringMatch`
a| Http Authority value to match. `exact`, `prefix`, `regex`

a| **headers**
a| `map<string, StringMatch>`
a| Headers key/value. `exact`, `prefix`, `regex`

a| **port**
a| int
a| Set port being addressed. If only one port exposed, not required

a| **sourceLabels**
a| `map<string, string`>
a| Caller labels to match

a| **gateways**
a| string[]
a| Names of the gateways where rule is applied to.
|===

<<<

Sending traffic depending on caller labels:

```yaml
- match:
  - sourceLabels:
      app: preference
      version: v2
  route:
  - destination:
      host: recommendation
      subset: version-v2
- route:
  - destination:
      host: recommendation
      subset: version-v1
```

When the calling service contains labels `app=preference` and `version=v2`, traffic is routed to **subset** `version-v2`. Otherwise, traffic is routed to `version-v1`

Mirroring traffic between two versions:

```yaml
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v1
    mirror:
      host: recommendation
      subset: version-v2
```

For routing purposes `VirtualService` also supports **redirects**, **rewrites**, **corsPolicies** or *appending* custom headers.

Apart from HTTP rules, `VirtualService` also supports matchers at _tcp_ level.

```yaml
spec:
  hosts:
  - postgresql
  tcp:
  - match:
    - port: 5432
      sourceSubnet: "172.17.0.0/16"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: postgresql
        port:
          number: 5555
```
--

Possible **match** options at _tcp_ level:

<<<

|===	
| Field | Type | Description
 
a| **destinationSubnet**
a| string
a| IPv4 or IPv6 of destination with optional subnet

a| **port**
a| int
a| Set port being addressed. If only one port exposed, not required

a| **sourceSubnet**
a| string
a| IPv4 or IPv6 of source with optional subnet

a| **sourceLabels**
a| `map<string, string`>
a| Caller labels to match

a| **gateways**
a| string[]
a| Names of the gateways where rule is applied to
|===

== Resilience

=== Retry
Retry 3 times when things go wrong before throwing the error upstream.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
  namespace: tutorial
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - retries:
      attempts: 3
      perTryTimeout: 4.000s
    route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v1
```

=== Timeout
You can add timeouts to communications, for example aborting call after 1 second:

```yaml
http:
- route:
  - destination:
      host: recommendation
  timeout: 1.000s
```

<<<

=== Outlier detection/Circuit breaking
If the request is forwarded to a certain instance and it fails (e.g. returns a 5xx error code), 
then this instance of an instance/pod can be ejected to serve any other client request for an amount of time (outlier detection).

In next example we see outlier detection after 5 consecutive errors, ejection analysis every 15 seconds, and in the case of host ejection, the host will be ejected for 2 minutes.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: recommendation
  namespace: tutorial
spec:
  host: recommendation
  trafficPolicy:
    outlierDetection:
      baseEjectionTime: 2m
      consecutiveErrors: 5
      interval: 15.000s
      maxEjectionPercent: 100
  subsets:
```

`trafficPolicy` can be applied at subset level to make it specific to a subset instead of all them.

You can also create connection pools at _tcp_ and _http_ level:

```yaml
trafficPolicy:
  connectionPool:
    http:
      http1MaxPendingRequests: 100
      http2MaxRequests: 100
      maxRequestsPerConnection: 1
    tcp:
      maxConnections: 100
      connectTimeout: 50ms
```

Traffic Policy possible values:

|===	
| Field | Type | Description

a|	**loadbalancer**
a| `LoadBalancerSettings`
a| Controlling load blancer algorithm

a| **connectionPool**
a| `ConnectionPoolSettings`
a| Controlling connection pool

a| **outlierDetection**
a| `OutlierDetection`
a| Controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts

a| **tls**
a| `TLSSettings`
a| TLS settings for connections

a| **portLevelSettings**
a| `PortTrafficPolicy[]`
a| Traffic policies specific to concrete ports
|===


== Policy Enforcement

Istio provides a model to enforce authorization policies in the communication between policies.
You can, for example, black-list or white-list intercommunication between services or add some quota.

You can configure that preference service only allows requests from the recommendation service.

```yaml
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: listchecker
metadata:
  name: preferencewhitelist
spec:
  overrides: ["recommendation"]
  blacklist: false
```

```yaml
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: listentry
metadata:
  name: preferencesource
spec:
  value: source.labels["app"]
---
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: rule
metadata:
  name: checkfromcustomer
spec:
  match: destination.labels["app"] == "preference"
  actions:
  - handler: preferencewhitelist.listchecker
    instances:
    - preferencesource.listentry
```

Source part is configured by using `listchecker` (to provide the list of allows hosts) and `listentry` (to configure how to get whitelist value from the request) elements.
Destination part and rule is configured by using the `rule` element.

|===	
| Field | Type | Description

a|	**providerUrl**
a| string
a| Url where to load the list to check against, can be empty

a| **refreshInterval**
a| `Duration`
a| How often provider is polled

a| List of entries consulted first before `providerUrl`

a| **entryType**
a| `ListEntryType`
a| The kind (`STRINGS`, `CASE_INSENSITIVE_STRINGS`, `IP_ADDRESSES, `REGEX`) of list entry and overrides

a| **blacklist**
a| boolean
a| the list operates as a blacklist or a whitelist
|===


== Telemetry, Monitoring and Tracing

Istio comes with observability providing out-of-the-box integration with Prometheus/Grafana and Jaeger (OpenAPI Spec).

== Service to Service Security

You can secure the communication between all services by enabling mutual TLS (peer authentication).

=== Mutual TLS

First, you need to enable mutual TLS.

You can enable it globally with *MeshPolicy*

```yaml
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "MeshPolicy"
metadata:
  name: "default"
spec:
  peers:
  - mtls: {}
```

[.single-block]
--

Or more fine-grained with *Policy*; in this case by namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "default"
  namespace: "tutorial"
spec:
  peers:
  - mtls: {}
```
--

Applying mTLS to specific destination and port:

```yaml
spec:
  target:
  - name: preference
    ports:
    - number: 9000
```

Important note: If `ports` not set then it is applied to all ports.

|===

a| **peers**
a| `PeerAuthentication`

`Method[]`
a| List of authentication methods for peer auth

a| **peerIsOptional**
a| boolean

=== End-user Authentication

End user authentication (origin authentication) using JWT:

```yaml
spec:
  origins:
  - jwt:
      issuer: "https://keycloak/auth/realms/istio"
      audiences:
      - "customer-tutorial"
      jwksUri: > 
        https://keycloak/auth/realms/istio
        /protocol/openid-connect/certs
  principaBinding: USE_ORIGIN
```

[.single-block]
--
After enabling mTLS, you need to configure it at the client side by using a `DestinationRule`.
Need to set which hosts communicate through mTLS using `host` field. 

```yaml
apiVersion: "networking.istio.io/v1alpha3"
kind: "DestinationRule"
metadata:
  name: "default"
  namespace: "tutorial"
spec:
  host: "*.tutorial.svc.cluster.local"
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
```

If **ISTIO_MUTUAL** is set, Istio configures client certificate, private key and CA crtificates with its internal implementation.

|===
|	Field| Type | Description
